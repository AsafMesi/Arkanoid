# Arkanoid

This is a Java implementation of the classic game Arkanoid, developed as part of an OOP course at Bar-Ilan university.

## Features

- Java implementation using the following OOP principles: polymorphism and inheritance, basic design patterns and generic collections.
- GUI interface 
- Contains multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
- Coded using a single thread
- Does not use built-in Java GUI, instead, it uses a custom GUI implementation which is included in the repository.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/AsafMesi/Arkenoid.git  
2. Open the project from an IDE such as IntelliJ or Visual Studio. 
3. Add the `biu-oop.jar` file as a global library to the Arkanoid project.
4. Make sure an updated JDK is set in the configuration for the menu to run on, and click play!

## Playing the Game

- Use the 'Left' and 'Right' arrows to control the paddle.
- Press 'p' to pause the game.
- Press 'Space' to re-enter the game.
- Remove all blocks in each level by striking them with the ball.
- Every block that you remove grants you 5 points, every level that you pass grants you 100 points. Try to get the highest score!

Note: The game has only 1 life, so use it carefully! 

## Requirements
